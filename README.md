Designed for multiple displays setup.
Select which monitors you want to keep undimmed and this app will dim the remaining connected monitors to the minimum brightness. Reverts to the previous brightness values once you're happy to have all monitors undimmed.

Currently only supported for Windows 7 or above.

### Instructions
Download the .jar from `Releases` and double click it to have it running in the background. Right click in the tray icon to start messing around with it.

If you want it to start running every time you start your computer then place the jar file in the directory `%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`.

### When do you want to use this
- Playing a game on one monitor while the other monitors keep reminding you about your crappy graphics card and how you barely run the game in one monitor, so you dim them to teach them a lesson;
- Watching a movie but the other monitors are radiating you with light and blinding you, ruining your movie experience;
- Disco party. easy to dj, the more monitors the better.

### Known limitations
- Some monitors are stubborn and don't let you allow to change the brightness through software so this app may not work for those type of monitors. You'll still see the monitor light blinking in some cases though which is the monitor laughing at you.
