Designed for multiple displays setup.
Select which monitors you want to keep undimmed and this app will dim the remaining connected monitors to the minimum brightness. Reverts to the previous brightness values once you're happy to have all monitors undimmed.

When do you want to use this:
- Playing a game on one monitor while the other monitors keep reminding you about your crappy graphics card and how you barely run the game in one monitor, so you dim them to teach them a lesson;
- Watching a movie but the other monitors are radiating you with light and blinding you, ruining your movie experience;
- Disco party. easy to dj, the more monitors the better. 

Currently only supported for Windows 7 or above.

Place the release .jar in the directory `%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` so it runs in the background from windows start up.

#### Known limitations
Some monitors are stubborn and don't let you allow to change the brightness through software so this app may not work for those type of monitors.
